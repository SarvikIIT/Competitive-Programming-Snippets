## Usage

1. Browse the snippets in the relevant category folder
2. Copy the snippet you need into your solution
3. Modify as needed for your specific problem

Simply copy and paste the relevant code snippet into your solution file during a contest.

```cpp
// Example: Copy the Segment Tree code into your solution
// Then use it in your main function

int main() {
    // Your implementation using the snippet
    return 0;
}
```
